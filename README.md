# Conclusion : 
In this unemployment scenario  a freelance job is one where a person works for themselves, rather than for a company. While freelancers do take on contract work for companies and organizations, they are ultimately self-employed. ... Freelancers are not considered “employees” by the companies they work for, but rather “contractors.” So this is one step towards employment in the country.
